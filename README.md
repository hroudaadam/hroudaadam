Hi! My name is Adam Hrouda. I am Czech student and developer.

My favourite technologies: .NET (mainly web APIs), Vue.js, p5.js. However always eager to learn and try anything else.

**Main projects:**
- [Onion architecture](https://github.com/hroudaadam/onion-architecture) - ASP.NET Web API template inspired by Onion architecture
- [Code around us](https://github.com/hroudaadam/code-around-us) - P5.js visualizations of random stuff
- [MindSphere SDK for .NET](https://github.com/hroudaadam/mindsphere-sdk-dotnet) - open-source .NET SDK for MindSphere APIs
- [Studentby](https://github.com/hroudaadam/studentby) - application for searching and offering student jobs (ASP.NET Core 3 + Vue.js)
